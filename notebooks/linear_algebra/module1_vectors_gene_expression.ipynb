    "\n",
    "Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used to produce a functional product, such as a protein. Although every cell in the human body contains the same DNA, each cell expresses a different subset of genes depending on its function and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In omics, gene expression is quantified as the number of RNA transcripts produced from each gene, often measured across many cells. These expression levels can be stored as vectors and matrices, allowing data scientists to analyze biological patterns using linear algebra.\n"
