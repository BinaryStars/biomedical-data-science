# ðŸ«€ Synthetic ECG Analysis in Python

This project simulates and visualizes synthetic ECG (Electrocardiogram) data using Python. It includes:

- ECG signal generation (simulated, 10 seconds, 500 Hz sampling)
- R-peak detection
- Heart rate computation
- Full and zoomed-in ECG plots
- Clean CSV file for reproducibility
